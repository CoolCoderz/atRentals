# **Guideliness for Contribution**
If you are contributing to the repository, then you should know the details of the following:
* Fork a repository
* Clone the repository
* Sync your fork

##    Fork a repository
To fork a repository means to copy that repository. By forking you can create the personal copy of any project. After this you can make changes according to your convenience and these changes will not affect the original project.

##    Clone the repository
In general clone means copied material which is exactly same as the original. In github, you can clone a repository to your local computer. Clonning a repository creates a local copy of the remote repo which allows you to edit the repo locally if you don't want to directly work on the source file of the original repo.

##    Sync your fork
Before making pull request you must make sure that your fork is up to date or not. If your fork is behind on commits, then there are some changes in the repository where you are contributing. In this case you have to sync the fork.
